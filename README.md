## General Info
Housing prices are one of the few expenses that can not ever be avoided. Purchasing a home is seen as a necessary step toward achieving "The American Dream". This, combined with the high prices of housing, mean that better methods of predicting prices are incredibly valuable. In this particular case, machine learning's ability to be trained using various variables and then to apply that to prediction makes it promising. A Convoluted Neural Network was used to create the machine, and the data was limited to the greater Phoenix metropolitan area.

This project was done for a data visualization bootcamp with particular interest towards learning to use machine learning.

## Technologies
* Python version: 3.6.10.final.0
* Pandas version: 1.0.4
* Numpy version: 1.18.1
* Matplotlib version: 3.2.1
* Scipy version: 1.4.1
* Tensorflow version: 2.1.0
* SQL
* Keras
* Plotly.py
* Sklearn
* CSS
* Javascript
* HTML
* Flask
* splinter
* BeautifulSoup
* Census python module

## Setup
In order to rerun the program for extracting census data, a config.py containing an API key for the census API (named "census_api_key" as a string) and located in 
the Resources folder will be necessary. Similarly, to ensure that the Zillow webscraping will work properly, ensure that Chrome and Chromedriver are fully updated and that chromedriver.exe is  located in the same folder as the zillow scraping program.
